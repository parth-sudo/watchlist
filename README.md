# Minimalist Watchlist. 
A watchlist designed to be simple, if not simpler.

# Purpose of this app-
There are a lot of anime / TV shows being released these days. I simply can't remember everything which I need to watch in my spare time. 


And for the "Ah! This anime! I had this in my mind but forgot to watch!" moments. I created this simple yet effective app which allows you to keep that watch order of yours (also the shows which you've already watched.)


Also, the list for every category is divided into 2 parts - Yet to Watch and Watched. So you don't have to worry about already watched shows. You can simply search them in the search show bar.
